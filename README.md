I am a relentless learner, and I believe in understanding all facets of the products I work on. Iâ€™m also a dedicated, empathetic team player who leads with emotional intelligence and delivers accordingly. 

Outside of coding, you may find me drawing. To some, it may seem that I am doodling, but actually, this is the way I think through complex questions, and cement the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained. By embracing my creativity I was able to succeed and become the talented Software Engineer that I am today.
